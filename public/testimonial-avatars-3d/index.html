  <figcaption>Create a set of 6 premium 3D avatar portraits (head and shoulders), NOT comic, high-end app marketing style, soft studio lighting, smooth realistic materials, subtle depth of field. Transparent background. No text. Each avatar should match these personas: (1) 'Recovered WhatsApp Survivor' - slightly tired but amused expression, casual hoodie, headphones around neck; (2) 'Reformed Ghoster' - friendly smile, holding phone, relaxed; (3) 'Professional Meeting Attendee' - neat hairstyle, blazer, focused expression, maybe glasses; (4) 'Chat Archaeologist' - curious look, messy hair, magnifying glass prop; (5) 'Accidental Adult' - surprised-confident smile, smart-casual outfit; (6) 'Time Enjoyer' - calm, zen smile, minimal outfit. Keep consistent style across all 6, diverse appearances.</figcaption>
