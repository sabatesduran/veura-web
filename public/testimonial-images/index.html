  <figcaption>Create a set of 6 playful, high-quality polaroid-photo-style illustrations (not photorealistic), each with a white polaroid frame and soft shadow, shot on a light lavender paper background with subtle dot texture. No text anywhere. Each image should visually represent the idea: (1) annoyed person with headphones and a phone showing long voice waveform + 2x speed icon; (2) happy person replying on chat bubbles because they can read voice notes now; (3) messy speech 'uhh' turning into clean typed lines (abstract transformation); (4) group chat chaos becoming neat readable text cards; (5) person copy-pasting a polished message and looking confident; (6) calendar/time icon with 'listen later' dread turning into 'read later' calm. Keep consistent style, warm lighting, slightly comedic props.</figcaption>
